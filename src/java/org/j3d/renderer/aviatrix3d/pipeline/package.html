Additional non-core implementations of the rendering pipeline functionality.
<p>

In this package you can find a collection of rendering pipeline pieces that can
be used in addition to, or separately from the core pipeline implementations.
These all implement the basic interfaces from the pipeline package.
<p>

There are no sub-packages based on device or pipeline type for now.

Scenegraph nodes that extend Aviatrix with new functionality.
<P>
Useful functionality that we haven't pushed to the core of Aviatrix3D.
Typically these nodes are not needed for a basic scenegraph but having
a common implementation is helpful.

These nodes also serve as examples of how you can extend the core Aviatrix scenegraph.
Note that you cannot extend Shape3D nodes.  Making a grouping node that does not
extend Group would likely require pipeline changes as well.

We expect others to donate code here, who's going to be the first?

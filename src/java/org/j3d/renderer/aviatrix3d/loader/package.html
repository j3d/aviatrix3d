Implementations of file loaders that produce an Aviatrix3D scene graph.
<P>


File loaders are built over the top of the basic parsing framework defined in
the {@link org.j3d.loaders} package and subpackages.

<h3>Limitations</h3>

Loaders are generally designed for static model loading and, as such don't
behave quite so well with model formats that also include a runtime component
(eg X3D/VRML97). Even for formats that do include runtime capabilities, a lot
of the time only the non-runtime part is required. The basic
{@link org.j3d.renderer.aviatrix3d.loader.AVLoader} interface represents
this desire for a loader's functionality to explicitly exclude some parts of
the model capability by the use of a set of load flags.
<p>

<h3>Using Loaders</h3>

The loaders are abstracted into a common interface that allows and application
to load models without needing to know about specific class names. A loader is
used to parse input in the form of a stream, file pointer or URL. In return,
you are given an instance of {@link org.j3d.renderer.aviatrix3d.loader.AVModel}
to fetch the loaded contents from.
<p>

<h3>Layers</h3>
<p>
The behaviour of the loader is is dependent on whether or not a fileformat and
particular file contain layers. Most formats do not contain any concept of
composited scenes, but a few do. Aviatrix3D also has the capability to render
composited scenes, so we allow model loaders to expose this capability as well.
</p>
<p>
When the user requests that layers are loaded, and some are found in the
requested file, then no root model is defined and
{@link org.j3d.renderer.aviatrix3d.loader.AVModel#getModelRoot()} will return
null. All content is accessed through the
{@link org.j3d.renderer.aviatrix3d.loader.AVModel#getLayers()} method. Layers
are returned in the order of front-most to rear-most. Layers that are defined,
but contain no content will still have valid layer object instances. With all
layers, unless the file format contains a specific size, the
{@link org.j3d.aviatrix3d.Viewport} will have zero size. It is up to the
calling application to ensure that viewports are correctly sized before
adding them to the scene.
</p>
<p>
When no layer loading is requested, or the loaded file does not contain any
layers, then the {@link org.j3d.renderer.aviatrix3d.loader.AVModel#getLayers()}
method will return an empty list and
{@link org.j3d.renderer.aviatrix3d.loader.AVModel#getModelRoot()} will return a
valid object representing the root of the loaded model.

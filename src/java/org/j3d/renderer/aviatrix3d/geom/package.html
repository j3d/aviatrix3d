with.

<H3>Implementation Details</H3>

Most of the primitives are direct extensions of the 
{@link org.j3d.aviatrix3d.Shape3D} class that fill in the geometry part of the
node, leaving the appearance settings up to the user. Some, however, do take
lower-level approach making use of the OpenGL evaluators to work on the 
Bezier patches.

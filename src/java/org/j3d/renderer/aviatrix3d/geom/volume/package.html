Volume rendering extensions to the Aviatrix3D scene graph.
<P>

This package provides some experimental rendering capabilities to integrate
volume rendering within Aviatr3D. It is expected that at some time, this package
will no longer be experimental and the contents will be moved into the core 
rendering API. 
<P>

<h3>Design Notes</h3>

The volume rendering capabilities use the latest techniques available with 
hardware accelerated shaders to do the work. If your hardware is not at least
an ATI Radeon 9700 or nVidia GeForce 5900 or later, this code will not run.
Software-only fallbacks are not provide (yet).

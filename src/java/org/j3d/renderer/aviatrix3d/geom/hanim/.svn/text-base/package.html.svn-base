Humanoid skinned-mesh representation for use with the Aviatrix3D scene graph. 
<P>

This component is specifically designed to implement the ISO H-Anim 
(ISO/IEC FDIS 19774) specification through the use of skinned mesh 
representations. It is possible, though not tested, to represent other 
non-humanoid-style skinned mesh objects using these classes. 
<P>

<h3>Design Notes</h3>

There are two versions of the code implementation that you could make use of:
software and hardware rendering. In the software version, the mesh is deformed
using a pure CPU-based software Java implementation. In the hardware version,
OpenGL GLSLang shaders are used to perform the skinning calculations using
shader hardware to allow a greater detail or more meshes being supported at
once. Note that if you make use of the shader implementation here, you will
not be able to make use of a generalised shader handling of the appearance for
the skin.

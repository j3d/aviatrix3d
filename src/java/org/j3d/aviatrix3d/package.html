<p>
A core set of lightweight Object Oriented scenegraph-based wrapper objects
for OpenGL. In this package are all the core nodes and interfaces that define
the basic structure of Aviatrix3D. These nodes represent the scenegraph itself,
but none of the rendering process.
</p>

<p>
For how the rendering is performed, see the following packages:
</p>

<ul>
<li>{@link org.j3d.aviatrix3d.pipeline}</li>
<li>{@link org.j3d.aviatrix3d.pipeline.audio}</li>
<li>{@link org.j3d.aviatrix3d.pipeline.graphics}</li>
<li>{@link org.j3d.aviatrix3d.output.audio}</li>
<li>{@link org.j3d.aviatrix3d.output.graphics}</li>
<li>{@link org.j3d.aviatrix3d.rendering}</li>
</ul>

<h3>Setting geometry</h3>

<p>Part of the optimisation we make is to only copy into the underlying
structures the exact number of coordinates, normals etc that are needed.
To know this number, we need to know how many coordinates exist before
attempting to set anything else. When constructing, or updating, geometry, you
should always make sure that you first set the vertex list, then the sizing
information for the strip or fan counts, and then set normals as needed.
</p>

<h3>Implementation Notes</h3>

<p>The following features are not implemented as at V2.0 even though the APIs and
classes exist.</p>

<ul>
<li>Multipass rendering</li>
<li>Light bounding and global flags - always locally scoped</li>
</ul>

Implementations of the various pipeline pieces.
<P>

All parts of the pipeline, except the surface are implemented in this package.
The interfaces are provided in the main Aviatrix package, while implementations
of those interfaces are to be found here.
<p>

These implementations provide the most commonly used functionality, but 
definitely not all of possible combinations. For example, a pipeline pieces for
single and multiple CPU machines are available.

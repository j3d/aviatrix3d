     j3d.org Standard GLSL Shaders

The shaders in this directory represent sections of the stock rendering
pipeline experessed as GLSL shaders. These allow you to replicate sections
of the pipeline using a normal shader, combined with those of your 
application-specific requirements. 

For each functionality, there is a shader that provides the full functionality,
and one that is just an empty function call. This allows you to turn on or off
a shader by simply selecting the appropriate source file.

All shaders in this directory only are licensed under the modified BSD-style 
license.

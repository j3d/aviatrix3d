The Aviatrix3D Open Source scene graph.
<p>

Aviatrix3D is a highly customisable Java scene graph running on top of OpenGL
and OpenAL. It is divided into two main sections - the core libraries under
the <code>org.j3d.aviatrix3d</code> root package, and optional utilities under
the <code>org.j3d.renderer.aviatrix3d</code> root package.

<p>
Design information and tutorials on how to use Aviatrix3D can be found on the
website <a href="http://aviatrix3d.j3d.org/">http://aviatrix3d.j3d.org/</a>.
Many of the utilities are built upon the core renderer-independent utilities
from the main <a href="http://code.j3d.org">j3d.org Code repository</a>.

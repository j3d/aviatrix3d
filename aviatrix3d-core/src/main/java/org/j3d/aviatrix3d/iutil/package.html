Internal utility classes to help the implementation of the main scene graph.
<P>

The classes in this package are not meant for public consumption outside of 
implementing and extending the scene graph classes. Since users may need to
extend classes with their own functionality, hiding classes in package-private
constructs makes this difficult to do. Thus, public implementations are placed
in this package so that those extending the scene graph can readily get to them
and make use of them.

Major Changes since 1.0

- Reorganised the interfaces to the rendering pipeline to not use 
  most of the user-facing classes. Now uses the separate Cullable/
  Renderable-derived interfaces. Some small exceptions still
  remaining but will be cleared by the next beta release

- Introduced a lot of customisation capabilities within the pipeline, 
  particularly with the ability to have your own culling and sorting
  code.

- Addition of SWT lightweight rendering capabilities (Draw2D and GEF)
  This is somewhat a work in progress as SWT Image handles are an issue
  with long running code. Works on SWT 3.2 and later.

- Introduction of VBO capabilities

- Many package changes for the renderer/pipeline classes. Now is a little
  bit more easy to see what belongs where. 

- Ability to create multiple independent windows that share a scene graph 
  and/or render management. 

- Multipass rendering ability. This allows for most multipass rendering
  techniques to be implemented. The one except we know of right now is
  shadow volumes due to the need to have a custom, infinite view frustum
  matrix. This will be fixed in 2.1.

- Layers (compositing) and viewports within a layer can be created. 

- Point sprite extensions added



Known Remaining Issues

- Nested Pbuffer (Pbuffer using a shader/texture that uses another Pbuffer) 
  usage still has some bugs.

- BlendAttributes is missing the ability to set the blend equation

- Ability to set custom view frustum matrices, which is needed for 
  shadow rendering capabilities

- Some startup/timing issues related to lightweight surfaces, particularly
  on OS/X

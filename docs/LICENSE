This codebase contains a lot of code, licensed under a number of different
licenses, dependent on the intended use. The text for each license may be
found in the same directory as this file is located.

Each directory is given relative to the root of the tree as checked out
from CVS.

GNU LGPL (LGPL.txt):
  All code under the /src directory
  All code under the /make directory
  All code under the /test directory
  Most of the pre-compiled libraries contained under /lib
    (need more specific detail on this)

BSD (BSD.txt):
  All code under /examples
  All code under /bin

Documents under /docs are not currently assigned a license, thus
redistributable under standard copyright terms.

Files in /contrib each have their own license. Please consult the source
to find out in each specific case.

This code makes reference to and includes a collection of prebuilt code 
from other j3d.org projects. Specifically the SWT OpenGL bindings. The 
source for that can be found at http://opengl.j3d.org/swt/ and is licensed
under the BSD License. That in turn is derived from Sun's BSD licensed
JSR 231 reference implementation.
